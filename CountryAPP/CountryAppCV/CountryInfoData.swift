        Baku has always been famous as a multi-ethnic city. The population of the capital of Azerbaijan reflects the ethnic composition of country.
             
        The official language is the Azerbaijani, but historically the Russian language was widespread. In recent years, as the result of the country’s integration into the international community, more and more people, especially young people also know the English language.

        Azerbaijan is the Muslim country according to the religious beliefs and due to the recent information, the population of Azerbaijan is more than 9 million people, the believers from other religions also feel comfortable and safe themselves here.
        
        It is a lively and very interesting city, where life does not stop even at night. Over the last ten years, Baku has greatly changed: new multi-storey buildings of shopping centers, hotels and banks harmonize very well with the old buildings. Baku is divided into 11 administrative districts.
        
        The settlements around Baku also have a very interesting history. Mashtagha is a good example for this as its name related to the tribes of Massagets, which settled here from prehistoric times. The history of the village Turkan is related to the Turkmen tribes proceeding from the opposite shores of the Caspian Sea and spreading over the western coasts of the sea and along Azerbaijan. It is evident that the name of the village is closely related to the name of the ancient tribes of Turkish roots which inhabited this region long ago.

        Shamakhi is one of Azerbaijan’s most historic cities and the birthplace of legendary Azerbaijani poets such as Sabir and Nesimi. Invaders and earthquakes have left little in the way of an old town but the city’s Juma Mosque was one of the first to be founded in the Caucasus and, in rebuilt form, is truly splendid. And across the valley Yeddi Gumbaz houses the tombs of Shamakhi’s last independent rulers.
        
        Climate is predominantly temperate with dry summers. Landscape is diverse – steppes alternate foothill meadows and forests and the higher above sea level the colder is autumn and the later melts the snow. Overall, however, the climate is mild, soil is fertile and flora and fauna are rich. There are roes, wild boars, wild cats, foxes, wolves, bears and many species of birds. Deciduous forests of hornbeams, beeches and oaks, verdure of the meadows covered in scarlet poppies in spring are a sheer eye candy. There are over 50 species of herbal plants growing in the area.
        
        Present Shamakhi district is the center of the ancient Shirvan, the former state of Shirvanshahs, a historical area of Azerbaijan. The name of the town was first mentioned by the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. In the IX century Shamakhi became the capital of the State of Shirvanshahs’ and was an important cultural and trading center

        The town has a glorious but tragic history -sadly, earthquakes, fire and invasions have left virtually nothing visible to remind the visitor of Şamaxı’s past importance. However, Shamakhi residents always found strength to restore the town and their lives. Presently, there are plenty of antique remainders around Shamakhi.

        The city of Ganja is located at the foot of the Minor Caucasian Ridge, on the Gjandzhachaj river. It was founded approximately in the 6th AD. In the first half of the 7th century Ganja was destroyed by Persians and in the second half by Arabs. In the mid-10 th century Ganja became the capital of Shadadit - one of a smaller khanates on the territory of Azerbaijan.

        In the mid-11th century Ganja was conquered by Seljuks. In 1139 there was a big earthquake which destroyed the city; in this connection it was transferred to another place. In the result of the earthquake a number of picturesque lakes was formed: Lake Gek - Gel, Lake Maral-Gel, Lake Dzheran-Gel, Lake Ordek-Gel, Lake Zaligehlyu, Lake Aggel, Lake Garagel and Lake Samlygel among them.

        After disintegration of Seljuk state Ganja became the second capital of Atabek state (12th-13th centuries). In the 18th century Ganja became the center of Ganja Khanate.
        
        In 1804 Ganja Khanate was occupied by Russian armies, and Ganja was renamed Elizabethpol. During Soviet time Ganja was renamed into Kirovabad and was the second biggest industrial and cultural city in Azerbaijan after Baku. The original name was given back to city after independence was won by the republic in 1991.

        During centuries-old history the city became the owner of numerous historical and architectural monuments with strongly pronounced Azerbaijan national color. Among the survived landmarks are Gei-Imam cult complex (14th – 17th centuries), Juma mosque (17th century) and a variety of picturesque old houses, well-known stone sculptures of horses and other pets abundant in the neighboring mountains.

        The city takes pride in the fact that the greatest Azerbaijani poet Nizami Gyanjevi was born there. His mausoleum is the major tourist attraction.

        The historical part of the city also called “Old Ganja” is known for its ruins of fortifications, towers, bridges (12th - early 13th centuries), a caravanserai (17th century) – place where merchant caravans could stay an have a rest, the building of former Khan office (17th century), mausoleums (14th – 17th centuries), mosques (17th centuries).

             Ankara is the capital city of Turkey and the country's second largest city after Istanbul. The city has a population (as of 2019) of 5,5 million, and a mean elevation of 850 m (2800 ft). It was formerly known as Angora. The Hittites gave it the name Ankuwash before 1200 BC, the Galatians and Romans called it Ancyra, and in the classical, Hellenistic, and Byzantine periods it was known as Ánkyra. Ankara also serves as the capital of the Province of Ankara.

             Centrally located in Anatolia, Ankara is an important commercial and industrial city. It is the center of the Turkish Government, and houses all foreign embassies. It is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the center of Turkey's highway and railway networks, and serves as the marketing center for the surrounding agricultural area. The city was famous for its long-haired Angora goat and its prized wool (mohair), a unique breed of cat (Angora cat), white rabbits and their prized wool (Angora wool), pears, honey, and the region's muscat grapes.

             Ankara is situated upon a steep and rocky hill, which rises 150 m above the plain on the left bank of the Enguri Su, a tributary of the Sakarya (Sangarius) river. The city is located at 39°52'30" North, 32°52' East (39.875° N 32.8333° E). Ankara is one of the driest places in Turkey and is surrounded by a barren steppe vegetation, with various Hittite, Phrygian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman archaeological sites. It has a harsh, dry continental climate with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.

             The hill which overlooks the city is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which adds to the picturesqueness of the view, but only a few historic structures surrounding the old citadel have survived to our date. There are, however, many finely preserved remains of Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine architecture, the most remarkable being the Temple of Augustus and Rome (20 BC) which is also known as the Monumentum Ancyranum.

            The Antalya Region, offering all the mysticism of past in our day, is now called the "Turkish Riviera" due to its archaeological and natural beauties. Antalya is the place where sea, sun, history and nature constitute a perfect harmony and which also includes the most beautiful and clearest coast along the Mediterranean. The city still preserves its importance as a center throughout history in the south coast of the country, in addition to its wonderful natural beauties. The mythological city which housed the Gods and Goddesses now exhibits all its secrets and marvels to mankind.

            Antalya is located in the west of the Mediterranean region. In ancient times it covered all Pamphylia which means "the land of all tribes". The land really deserves the name since it has witnessed many successive civilizations throughout history. In 1st century BC the Pergamum king Attalus ordered his men to find the most beautiful piece of land on earth; he wanted them to find "heaven on earth". After a long search all over the world, they discovered this land and said "This must be 'Heaven' " and King Attalus founded the city giving it the name "Attaleia". From then on many nations kept their eyes on the city. When the Romans took over the Pergamene Kingdom, Attaleia became an outstanding Roman city which the great Roman Emperor Hadrian visited in 130 AD; an arch was built in his honor which is now worth seeing. Then came the Byzantines, after which the Seljuk Turks took over the city in 1207 and gave it a different name, Adalya, and built the Yivli Minaret. The Ottomans followed the Seljuks and finally within the Turkish Republic it became a Turkish city and an important port. Antalya has been growing rapidly since 1960 and its population is 1,146,109 according to the 1990 census.

            The climate of the province is typical Mediterranean: hot and dry in summers and temperate and rainy in winters. Sunshine is guaranteed from April to October and the winters are pleasantly mild. The humidity is a little bit high, about 64%, and the average water temperature is 21.5 °C. Antalya is really a heavenly place where the summer season is about 8-9 months long.

For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as "the City of Light".[7]

        The City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of France,[2] making the region France's primate city.

        Marseille, also spelled Marseilles, ancient Massilia or Massalia, city, capital of Bouches-du-Rhône département, southern France, and also the administrative and commercial capital of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, one of France’s fastest growing régions. Located west of the French Riviera, Marseille is one of the major ports of the Mediterranean Sea. It is situated on the Mediterranean’s Gulf of Lion within a semicircle of limestone hills and lies 536 miles (863 kilometres) south-southeast of Paris by rail and 218 miles southeast of Lyon. Area city proper, 93 square miles (241 square kilometres); metropolitan area, 365 square miles (946 square kilometres). Pop. (1999) city, 807,071; metropolitan area, 1,349,772; (2005 est.) city, 826,700; metropolitan area, 1,384,000.

        Founded more than 2,500 years ago, the port city of Marseille (English conventional spelling Marseilles) has a history of vigorous independence asserted against central authority in a variety of forms. It retained its status as a free city even after falling to Julius Caesar’s troops in the 1st century BCE, and after centuries of decline it was revived and allowed great independence under the local control of the viscounts of Provence in the 10th–14th centuries. After Provence joined the Kingdom of France in the 15th century, Marseille retained a separate administration and continually engaged in spirited revolt against kings or governments that threatened its liberties. It was for this reason that in 1800, when France was divided into the present administrative départements, Marseille was only reluctantly granted its status as capital of the Bouches-du-Rhône.

        French people elsewhere, convinced that the Mediterranean climes of Provence could never be fully integrated into either the French realm or the Gallic spirit, long looked upon Marseille as a sort of folkloric institution: a place of comic anecdote and dialect, with a seasoning of picturesque criminality; a place where the citizens played a peculiar form of outdoor bowling known as pétanque, concocted the glorious garlic- and saffron-flavoured fish stew known as bouillabaisse, and consumed rich, savory, absinthe-like Provençal pastis.

        Rome, Italian Roma, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province), of Lazio regione (region), and of the   country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past. Area city, 496 square miles (1,285 square km); province, 2,066 square miles (5,352 square km). Pop. (2011) city, 2,617,175; province, 3,997,465; (2022 est.) city, 2,761,632; province, 4,222,631.
        Rome’s contemporary history reflects the long-standing tension between the spiritual power of the papacy and the political power of the Italian state capital. Rome was the last city-state to become part of a unified Italy, and it did so only under duress, after the invasion of Italian troops in 1870. The pope took refuge in the Vatican thereafter. Rome was made the capital of Italy (not without protests from Florence, which had been the capital since 1865), and the new state filled the city with ministries and barracks. Yet the Catholic church continued to reject Italian authority until a compromise was reached with Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in 1929, when both Italy and Vatican City recognized the sovereignty of the other. Mussolini, meanwhile, created a cult of personality that challenged that of the pope himself, and his Fascist Party tried to re-create the glories of Rome’s imperial past through a massive public works program.
        
            Around the ninth or tenth century B.C., Rome was just a small town on the Tiber River in what’s now central Italy. (One myth says that the town was founded by two brothers—Romulus and Remus—who were raised by a wolf.) For about 500 years, the area was ruled by a series of kings as it grew in strength and power.

            But around the year 509 B.C., the last king was overthrown, and Rome became a republic. That meant that some citizens could vote for their leaders and other important matters. Only male Roman citizens could cast votes; women and enslaved people—often brought back as prisoners from military battles—could not.

            Elected officials included two consuls who acted sort of like today’s U.S. presidents and kept each other from taking too much power. Both consuls worked with senators, who advised the consuls and helped create laws. Senators were appointed by other officials and could hold their positions for life.

            The Roman army fought many wars during this period, first conquering all of what’s now Italy. In 146 B.C., they destroyed the city of Carthage (in modern-day Tunisia, in northern Africa), which was Rome’s greatest rival for trade in the western Mediterranean Sea. Next they conquered Greece.

        Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the province of Florence.
        The city lies on the River Arno and is known for its history and its importance in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance, especially for its art and architecture. A centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of the time. Florence is considered the birthplace of the Renaissance. A turbulent political history included periods of rule by the powerful Medici family, religious and republican revolution. From 1865 to 1870 the city was also the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Florence is often known as the "Jewel of the Renaissance".

        The historic centre of Florence attracts millions of tourists each year and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982. Florence is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and its artistic, historic and cultural heritage and impact in the world remains to this day. The city has a major impact in music, architecture, education, cuisine, fashion, philosophy, science and religion. The historic centre of Florence contains elegant squares (piazzas), Renaissance palaces (palazzi), academies, parks, gardens, churches, monasteries, museums, art galleries and ateliers. The city has also been nominated, according to a 2007 study, as the most desirable destination for tourists in the world. The city boasts a wide range of collections of art, especially those held in the Pitti Palace and the Uffizi, (which receives about 1.6 million tourists a year). Florence is arguably the last preserved Renaissance city in the world and is regarded by many as the art capital of Italy. It has been the birthplace or chosen home of many notable historical figures, such as Dante, Boccaccio, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Niccolò Machiavelli, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Donatello, Galileo Galilei, Catherine de' Medici, Luigi Cherubini, Antonio Meucci, Guccio Gucci, Franco Zeffirelli, Salvatore Ferragamo, Roberto Cavalli, and Emilio Pucci.
        
        Florence was founded to control the only practicable north-south crossing of the Arno River to and from the three passes through the Apennines: one to Faenza and two to Bologna. Two thin streams, the Mugnone and the Affrico, come down through town to meet the Arno. The Affrico, not far away from its source in the Apennines, is usually a grudging gurgle amid wide gravel beds far below the quays, but sometimes it rises and swells into a powerful stream, ravaging the city with floods. The city’s water supply has also served as an asset, however, making possible the washing, fulling, and dyeing of cloth, resulting in the development of a major industry.
